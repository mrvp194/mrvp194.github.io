			<h3>Stereotype Threat</h3>
			<h5>11/17/2014</h5>
			<p>My experiences with stereotype threat are rather unique if I do say so myself.  I have been fortunate enough to have been given the initial of MVP.  I'm actually not even sure if this was done on purpose by my parents when they named me Michael.  Every time I tell this to someone who hasn't gotten a feel for my personality yet will immediately stereotype me in one way or the other.  I've seen it all from they now think I'm the coolest dude ever to they now think I'm some egotistical jerk.  The judgments are never right.  It took me a while to get the right timing for when to best tell everyone my little secret without them judging my character.</p>
			<p>This definitely isn't as bad as most stereotype threats, but it has definitely held me back socially in a number of ways when first meeting someone as it becomes an uphill challenge to change their set opinion.  If I start to feel this happening the only thing I can really do is be myself.  Eventually they'll see past their stereotypes.  As for if I suspect someone else being stereotyped it really depends on the degree.  Although confrontation isn't my strongest trait I would try to point out the miss-step in judgment if it was serious enough.</p>
