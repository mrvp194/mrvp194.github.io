Shereef's Fireside Chat definetely confirmed many of the reasons I was drawn to and joined DBC.  I really enjoy learning when I'm surrounded by a relatively small group of like-minded people where there's a strong sense of camaraderie.  I try to look for this  sense of community whenever joining any sort of program or institution.  So far everyone I have met that is involved with DBC has been great to work with.  Although I am understandably nervous to take this next step in my life, I am very excited for it.
