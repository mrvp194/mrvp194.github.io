			<h3>Pairing & Feedback</h3>
			<h5>11/9/2014</h5>
			<p>Pairing has been a very interesting experience to undertake over the past couple weeks. Initially, I was pretty nervous to pair since I'm normally a lone ranger when it comes to tackling a challenge. After my first pairing session, however, I realized how powerful it could be. It really helped reduce errors I might've made in my code and sped up my efficiency quite a bit. At times it's hard to keep the Navigator/Driving roles<br>

			<h3>Ruby Classes</h3>
			<h5>11/9/2014</h5>
			<p>Today I'm going to discuss classes in ruby and when to use instance vaiables and methods.  I'll start off with an explanation of local variables.  A Local Variable is a variable that is defined in a method.  Local variables cannot be accessed outsite of the method.  Local variable begin with a lowercase letter or _ and are most likely the kind of variables you've been using up to this point.<br>

			<h3>Tech Issues</h3>
			<h5>11/2/2014</h5>
			<p>One problem facing the tech world that I find particulary interesting is the rate at which technology becomes obsolete.  From pc's to external hard drives or even programming languages, everything technology related seem to have a very short life span.<br>

		    <h3>The Cycle Enumerable</h3>
			<h5>11/2/2014</h5>
			<p>Enumerable#cycle can be called on any enumerable object (a range, hash, or array)Cycle calls a block of code that you provide for each element however many times you specify.  If you do not choose the amount of times to run the block, it will repeat forever.<br>

			<h3>My Thinking Style</h3>
			<h5>10/26/2014</h5>
			<p>When I took the personal thinking style quiz from thelearningweb.net a couple weeks ago I discovered that my style is Concrete Sequential and Concrete Random.  My scores were actually all fairly close together.  My scores in Abstract Sequential and Abstract Random were only one point behind Concrete Sequential and Concrete Random.<br>

			<h3>Arrays vs Hashes</h3>
			<h5>10/26/2014</h5>
			<p>Ruby's arrays and hashes are fairly similar but differ in one distinct way.  An array is an integer-indexed collection of any object.<br>

			<h3>Absolute, Relative, and Fixed Positioning.</h3>
			<h5>10/19/2014</h5>
			<p>Today I'm going to go over the differences of relative, absolute, and fixed positioning.  These properties are very useful to designing a website and allow you to position your tags in a couple of different ways.  To help with your understanding, think of the elements on a web page as blocks.<br>

			<h3>Chef's Fireside Response</h3>
			<h5> 10/12/2014</h5>
			<p>Shereef's Fireside Chat definetely confirmed many of the reasons I was drawn to and joined DBC.  I really enjoy learning when I'm surrounded by a relatively small group of like-minded people where there's a strong sense of camaraderie.<br>

			<h3>Intro to git</h3>
			<h5>10/12/2014</h5>
			<p>Version control is a developer's best friend.  It allows them to track the changes they make to their code, kind of like how you would save you document in word.  With Version Control, developers don't have to worry about writing a new line a code that might crash their project because they can always go back to a previously saved version.<br>
