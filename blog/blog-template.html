			<h3>Conflict</h3>
			<h5>11/30/2014</h5>
			<p>Recently I was on a 45 day backpacking trip in the Australian wild.  When you're around the same group of people every single hour for 45 days without much alone time it's easy to get sick of some of those people around you.<br>

			<h3>Test-Driven Development</h3>
			<h5>11/30/2014</h5>
			<p>Test-driven development is a commonly used software development process that relies on a developer initialy writing test code that defines a new feature or improvement to the program.  The developer then produces the minimum amount of code necesary to past the tests and finishes by refactoring that code.<br>

			<h3>Stereotype Threat</h3>
			<h5>11/23/2014</h5>
			<h4>Release 2: Select a Value</h4>
			<p>Many of the listed values are important to me but today I am going to focus on physical challenge.  Physical challenges have been an instrumental part of my growth for my whole life.  I believe that a good physical challenge will help one identify and push their limits.  Not only are these limits physical but they also represent you emotional limits as you recognize your tolerance to adversity.<br>

			<h3>Ruby Hashes vs. JavaScript Objects</h3>
			<h5>11/23/2014</h5>
			<p>Ruby hashes and JavaScript Objects are very similar in many ways.  If you were to look at what both of them looked like next to eachother you would probably have a little bit of difficulty telling the two apart.  For example:<br>

			<h3>Ruby Blocks, Procs, and Lambdas</h3>
			<h5>11/16/2014</h5>
			<p>As the title suggests, today I am going to discuss the differences between blocks, procs and lambdas in ruby.  Referred to as closures in Computer Science, they are a vital part of ruby.  To start off, blocks are the most common way to use a closure in Ruby. <br>

			<h3>Stereotype Threat</h3>
			<h5>11/16/2014</h5>
			<p>My experiences with stereotype threat are rather unique if I do say so myself.  I have been fortunate enough to have been given the initial of MVP.  I'm actually not even sure if this was done on purpose by my parents when they named me Michael.<br>

			<h3>Pairing & Feedback</h3>
			<h5>11/9/2014</h5>
			<p>Pairing has been a very interesting experience to undertake over the past couple weeks. Initially, I was pretty nervous to pair since I'm normally a lone ranger when it comes to tackling a challenge. After my first pairing session, however, I realized how powerful it could be. It really helped reduce errors I might've made in my code and sped up my efficiency quite a bit. At times it's hard to keep the Navigator/Driving roles<br>

			<h3>Ruby Classes</h3>
			<h5>11/9/2014</h5>
			<p>Today I'm going to discuss classes in ruby and when to use instance vaiables and methods.  I'll start off with an explanation of local variables.  A Local Variable is a variable that is defined in a method.  Local variables cannot be accessed outsite of the method.  Local variable begin with a lowercase letter or _ and are most likely the kind of variables you've been using up to this point.<br>

			<h3>Tech Issues</h3>
			<h5>11/2/2014</h5>
			<p>One problem facing the tech world that I find particulary interesting is the rate at which technology becomes obsolete.  From pc's to external hard drives or even programming languages, everything technology related seem to have a very short life span.<br>

		    <h3>The Cycle Enumerable</h3>
			<h5>11/2/2014</h5>
			<p>Enumerable#cycle can be called on any enumerable object (a range, hash, or array)Cycle calls a block of code that you provide for each element however many times you specify.  If you do not choose the amount of times to run the block, it will repeat forever.<br>

			<h3>My Thinking Style</h3>
			<h5>10/26/2014</h5>
			<p>When I took the personal thinking style quiz from thelearningweb.net a couple weeks ago I discovered that my style is Concrete Sequential and Concrete Random.  My scores were actually all fairly close together.  My scores in Abstract Sequential and Abstract Random were only one point behind Concrete Sequential and Concrete Random.<br>

			<h3>Arrays vs Hashes</h3>
			<h5>10/26/2014</h5>
			<p>Ruby's arrays and hashes are fairly similar but differ in one distinct way.  An array is an integer-indexed collection of any object.<br>

			<h3>Absolute, Relative, and Fixed Positioning.</h3>
			<h5>10/19/2014</h5>
			<p>Today I'm going to go over the differences of relative, absolute, and fixed positioning.  These properties are very useful to designing a website and allow you to position your tags in a couple of different ways.  To help with your understanding, think of the elements on a web page as blocks.<br>

			<h3>Chef's Fireside Response</h3>

			<p>Shereef's Fireside Chat definetely confirmed many of the reasons I was drawn to and joined DBC.  I really enjoy learning when I'm surrounded by a relatively small group of like-minded people where there's a strong sense of camaraderie.<br>

			<h3>Intro to git</h3>
			<h5>10/12/2014</h5>
			<p>Version control is a developer's best friend.  It allows them to track the changes they make to their code, kind of like how you would save you document in word.  With Version Control, developers don't have to worry about writing a new line a code that might crash their project because they can always go back to a previously saved version.<br>
