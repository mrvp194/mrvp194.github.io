			<h3>Pairing & Feedback</h3>
			<h5>11/9/2014</h5>
			<p>Pairing has been a very interesting experience to undertake over the past couple weeks.  Initially, I was pretty nervous to pair since I'm normally a lone ranger when it comes to tackling a challenge.  After my first pairing session, however, I realized how powerful it could be.  It really helped reduce errors I might've made in my code and sped up my efficiency quite a bit.  At times it's hard to keep the Navigator/Driving roles.  When we hit a roadblock because it becomes an almost frantic search to figure out the next step.  I would like to improve on this in the future.  <br></p>
			<p>Similar to pairing, I felt fairly nervous looking at my first piece of feedback.  Luckily, it was all pretty positive.  So far I've recieved pretty good reviews so I don't have much to complain about.  One thing I have noticed is that I usually don't recieve much actionable feedback.  Sometimes it's hard pinpoint what could really be improved upon in a session and there are times I can tell the person just made something up.  I find I have similar struggles when writing feedback for another.  I actually just finished a program where feedback was very much incorporated into the environment and considered to be crucial to our development, so you'd think I'd be a bit more used to it.  Unfortunately, I still do not enjoy giving feedback and I fear I never will.  It's hard to be completely honest with someone, even with anonymoty.  This is something I would definetely like to improve upon going foward.</p>
