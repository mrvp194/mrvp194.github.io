			<h3>Tech Issues</h3>
			<h5>11/2/2014</h5>
			<p>One problem facing the tech world that I find particularly interesting is the rate at which technology becomes obsolete.  From pc's to external hard drives or even programming languages, everything technology related seem to have a very short life span.  For example, I just bought my pc about a year ago.  I wanted something that could run all of the latest video games that wouldn't create a giant hole in my pocket.  I ended up finding a great deal on a newly released computer and was thoroughly satisfied for about year.  Recently, however, I've started to notice that I can barely play any of the more complicated games out and I am afraid that I will need some sort of update within another 6 months.  Don't get me wrong, I love the fact that video games' graphics are getting better and better every day, but shouldn't I be able to buy a computer and not worry about a major upgrade for at least a couple years?  <br><br>Another example of this is with data storage devices like an external hard drive.  When I'm at my parents' house it's hard not to notice the piles of floppy disks, CD's, other old obsolete storage devices laying around.  All of this data is just sitting there with no easy way to access it.  It makes me turn to my external hard drive with all of my precious files and wonder how long that kind of technology will last.  <br><br>I know it's a big part of tech corporations to make what they just released obsolete so you have to buy their new stuff, but I think it has been pushed too far in many cases.  I would like to see a tech world that cares about backwards compatibility, rather than making it impossible.  This issue can only be changed by the consumer.  If we make it known that we will not accept planned obsolescence than perhaps corporations will have no choice than to listen.  At this rate, however, I find it very unlikely.</p>
