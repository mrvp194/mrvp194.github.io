			<h3>Stereotype Threat</h3>
			<h5>11/23/2014</h5>
			<h4>Release 2: Select a Value</h4>
			<p>Many of the listed values are important to me but today I am going to focus on physical challenge.  Physical challenges have been an instrumental part of my growth for my whole life.  I believe that a good physical challenge will help one identify and push their limits.  Not only are these limits physical but they also represent you emotional limits as you recognize your tolerance to adversity.  So, physical challenges have a big impact on your mentality and your ability to take all of the crap that life throws at you.</p>
			<h4>Release 3: Values in your life</h4>
			<p>Physical Challenge: 4<br>
			Accountability: 4<br>
			Adventure: 4
			Ambition: 5<br>
			Challenge: 4<br>
			Compassion: 5<br>
			Close relationships: 5<br>
			Confidence: 5<br>
			Competition: 3<br>
			Courage: 3<br>
			Decisiveness: 5<br>
			Creativity: 5<br>
			Health: 3<br>
			Growth: 5</p>
			<h4>Release 4: Advice</h4>
			<p>The last topic someone asked for my advice was my father and his assistant attempting to export a quickbooks save file to thumb drive.  The problem was that after they tried to export there was a popup asking them to rebuild the save file.  They failed to read to fine print which said that quickbooks just needed to make a local backup of the file before exporting and came to me for help.  I just had to click rebuild on the popup and everything was fine.</p>
			<h4>Release 5: Values and Stereotype Threat</h4>
			<p>I feel pretty good about my values although there is always room for improvement.  Of course, I would love to work out more, grow more, be more considerate and so on, but I can really only tackle one at a time and sometimes when you focus on one you lose a little from another.  Of course it can help mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it, otherwise you're just feeling sad without any knowledge as to why.  It's important to be in touch with your feelings.</p>
