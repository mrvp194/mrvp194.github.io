			<h3>My Thinking Style</h3>
			<h5>10/26/2014</h5>
			<p>When I took the personal thinking style quiz from thelearningweb.net a couple weeks ago I discovered that my style is Concrete Sequential and Concrete Random.  My scores were actually all fairly close together.  My scores in Abstract Sequential and Abstract Random were only one point behind Concrete Sequential and Concrete Random.  I even took the quiz again more recently in which CS and AR were first and CR and AS were only one point behind.  After looking through a more detailed description of each style I've decided I relate to CR the most while I could only find a couple descriptions from each of the other styles that I felt sounded like me.  <br><br>
			My biggest struggle in Phase 0 so far has been time management followed by communicating with my fellow cohort.  Without much surprise, both of these traits are related to Concrete Random thinking (reference: http://www.floatingneutrinos.com/Message/arcs/links_on_abstractrandom.htm).  These struggles haven't been hard to overcome as of yet but to better combat them I plan to stick to a tighter work schedule.  I would ideally like to have my whole day planned before it starts so I have a rough idea of how long every task will take.  I usually just keep all of my plans for the day in my head but I think it would be more efficient to write it all out rather than trying to remember everything.  This has been a hard concept to implement into my Concrete Random lifestyle but I believe I can overcome my chaotic thinking style with a bit of determination.<br><br>
			Reading about Growth and Fixed Mindsets reminds me of when I first started playing baseball.  When I started playing around 7 years old I might have been the worst guy on the team.  It wasn't that I didn't care, I just simply had no skills or experience.  After a couple years of failure my father told me if I simply played more and practiced my skills that I could be the best on the team.  I took his advice and practiced more and after a year that's pretty much exactly what happened.  Ever since then I haven't been afraid to learn a new skill because I knew with enough effort I could become quite competent at it.  <br>
			That being said, I don't always relate with a growth mindset.  There are times that I feel that I have a fixed mindset when I take a failure, otherwise known as a learning experience, to harshly.  I would like to improve on this, but at the same time I believe that it can be beneficial.  It just needs to be regulated more effectively.
